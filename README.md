# AutoBooking
An android app for automated room booking system.

Incorporated the hierarchical structure of room booking by including verification from the Authority and Security .<br>
Included features of submitting/cancelling booking requests and seeing pending applications from the Applicant Side.<br>
Included features of accepting/rejecting booking request and seeing pending applications from the Verification Side.

We intend to provide an interface between the applicants and the concerned authorities where the applicant can choose a room and slot ( day - time ) based on availability. Each Application is sent to the concerned authoritiesâ€™ database for verification/approval. The applicant can also view the status of their approvals at any instant. We shall also support the cancellation of bookings.

Our basic aim is to reduce the hassle which applicants need to face each time they need to book a room.
